# XInput.Wrapper

- It is a short and monolithic C# class that can be embedded as source code in any project (1 source file).
- No external libraries, except XInput1_4.DLL but it ships today as a system component in Windows 8/8.1/10. It is available "inbox" and does not require redistribution with an application.
- To implement this class into your own project, just add the "X.cs" class file and start using it without any restriction. Anyway if you want you can add a reference to bin\XInput.Wrapper.dll.
